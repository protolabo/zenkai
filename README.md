## Libraries

### STD

The Standard library (STD) main goal is to be used as a base for any JS project and therefore has no browser dependency.
It focuses on extending the capabilities of Javascript data types and expanding some of the language concepts such as AJAX, Logic and Path.

### DOM

The Document library (DOM) primary goal is to provide a richer and more direct API to manipulate elements.
This library enforces structure validation to stay conform to the web standards and as a bonus always yields valid elements.
